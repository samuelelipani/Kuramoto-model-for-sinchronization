# Kuramoto-model-for-sinchronization
This thesis considers the phenomenon of synchronization by analyzing its physical characteristics through the developed mathematical models over time. After introducing the meaning of synchronization and the properties of a such a physical system, the Peskin and Winfree model are examined. They chronologically and conceptually precede Kuramoto's model. For its simplicity and effectiveness the product of the theories will be studied by Kuramoto himself implementing the results with numerical simulations in MATLAB. The work ends by showing an interesting application of the model: the synchronization of neurons in the brain under determined conditions of mutual connection. From this application it is derived a further numerical simulation designed to verify the provisions of the template.
